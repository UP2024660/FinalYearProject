UP2024660's Final Year Project

## Abstract
A new software called "Active Learning Design" was made for teachers at a university (UoP). It helps teachers make new classes, sections of classes, and lesson plans more easily.

The tool lets teachers write descriptions of what they will teach for each section. It then shows how everything connects together in a diagram using circles and lines. This shows relationships between topics.

Other existing tools don't work as well. They make lesson plans too static and rigid. They don't allow for differences between student groups.

"Active Learning Design" uses a simple interface and visual charts to overcome these issues. It aims to better support more interactive teaching styles that engage students more. The goal is to help the move toward lessons that are less boring and more interesting for students.

Overall, it provides teachers a better way to design their teaching plans to suit different learners and teaching styles in a more flexible way compared to other options.
